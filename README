== Purpose ==

`WhiteSpace' extension introduces two tags to control white space:

* <dws/> discards itself and all the whitespace (including newlines) after, up to the first
non-whitespace character.

* <nl/> discards itself but inserts a newline.

Primary purpose of the tags -- allow nice (almost free) formatting in templates, for example:

 {{ The first
    |   Arg1
    |   Arg2
 }}<dws/>
 {{  The second
 }}

In resulting text there will not be any space between the results of templates.

== License ==
